I need a python program that will do the following:

Wait until there are no active live-migrations on the cluster.
from-list is a list of openshift worker nodes with > 50% CPU utilization that are hosting kubevirt pods.
to-list is a list of schedulable worker nodes with < 20% CPU utilization.

Do the following a long as both from-list and to-list aren't empty
{
    low-node = member of to-list with lowest CPU usage
    hot-node = member of from-list with highest CPU usage

    hot-vms = list of VM pods on hot-node
    {
       hot-vm = a VM from hot-vms, which we remove from hot-vms
       live-migrate hot-vm from hot-node so that the k8s scheduler can place it somewhere else
       wait until the live-migration succeeds or fails
    } repeat unless live migration is successful

    wait until there are no active live-migrations on the cluster.
    recompute from-list and to-list
  }
}
